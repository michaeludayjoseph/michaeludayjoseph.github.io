**Course description:** In this course, we will explore various methods and techniques that are useful in various areas of computation theory. We will see how combinatorial and probabilistic technique, polynomial approach, Fourier analysis and linear algebraic technique can be applied to solve various problems in theoretical computer science. We will illustrate the techniques by the examples in theory of algorithms, computational complexity, learning theory, property testing and other areas.
