**(Under construction)**

I am a PhD student in computer science at [Tufts University](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/), where I am advised by [Saeed Mehraban](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedmehraban/about). I am a part of the [CS Theory](https://cs-theory.cs.tufts.edu/) and [Quantum Information Science]() groups at Tufts, and also maintain the [Tufts QIS blog](https://tuftsqis.wordpress.com/).
