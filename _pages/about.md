**Under construction.**

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Tufts University](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Saeed Mehraban](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedmehraban/about). I am also a part of the [CS Theory](https://cs-theory.cs.tufts.edu/) and [Quantum CS]() groups, and maintain the [Tufts QIS blog](https://tuftsqis.wordpress.com/).
